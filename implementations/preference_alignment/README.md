# Introduction to Preference Alignment with LLM-as-a-Judge (DPO)

This reference implements the **Con-J framework** from:

> - Ye, Z., et al., (2025).
Learning LLM-as-a-Judge for Preference Alignment.
https://openreview.net/forum?id=HZVIQE1MsJ

Con-J trains an LLM to act as a **generative judge** using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), instead of relying on a scalar reward model.

## Why Not a Scalar Reward Model?

Traditional preference alignment (e.g., RLHF-style reward models) trains a model to assign a **scalar score** to each answer.

However, as shown in the following figure:

- Scalar models output only a number → ❌ No explanation  
- They are more susceptible to dataset bias  
- They may learn superficial patterns (e.g., verbosity)

Con-J instead trains an **LLM-as-a-Judge** that generates:

- A natural language **rationale**
- A binary **preference decision**

This improves:

- Interpretability  
- Robustness to bias  
- Alignment transparency

## Con-J Training Pipeline

The full framework is illustrated in the following figure.

The process consists of three stages:

### 1️⃣ Judgment Sampling(Repeated and Hint Sampling)
Given a prompt `q` and answers `(a₁, a₂)`,  
the pretrained LLM generates multiple **judgments with rationales**.

### 2️⃣ Judgment Filtering
Using ground-truth preference labels, judgments are separated into:

- **Positive judgments** (correct preference)
- **Negative judgments** (incorrect or unclear preference)

These are paired to form **contrastive judgment pairs**.

### 3️⃣ Contrastive Training (DPO)
The LLM is trained using:

- **DPO loss** on contrastive pairs  
- A small **SFT loss** on positive judgments  

This directly optimizes the model to prefer correct judgments while maintaining generation quality.

## Dataset Preparation

The filtered `.parquet` files are not included in this repository.

Please follow one of the options below to obtain the dataset.

---

## Download Pre-Filtered Dataset (Recommended)

The filtered dataset used in this implementation is hosted in a GCP bucket.

Download the `.parquet` files using:

```bash
gsutil cp gs://<bucket-name>/reference_implementation_4/*.parquet .
```
*** Do not download the ```train_raw.parquet```, use the ```train_sponsor_filtered.parquet``` for data_sky or ```train_singleturn_sponsor_filtered.parquet``` for data_hh_rlhf ***

After downloading, place the ```.parquet``` file inside one of the following folders (create the folder if it does not exist):
```data_sky/```  or
```data_hh_rlhf/```
Then proceed with:

```01_dataset_construction.ipynb```

## Using Your Own Dataset

Participants may use their own preference dataset with this implementation.

Your dataset must satisfy the following structure.

---

### Required Fields

Each example must contain:

- `chosen`   — Preferred response
- `rejected` — Non-preferred response

These represent a pair of candidate responses where `chosen` is preferred over `rejected`.

---

### Supported Formats

#### Format 1 — Structured Chat Format (Sky-style)

```python
{
  "chosen": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "..."},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}
  ],
  "rejected": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "..."},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}
  ]
}
```

In this case, set:
- dataset_format = "sky"

#### Format 2 — Raw Conversation String (HH-style)

```python
{
  "chosen": "Human: ... Assistant: ...",
  "rejected": "Human: ... Assistant: ..."
}
```

In this case, set:
- dataset_format = "hh"

### Adding a New Format

If your dataset follows a different structure:

1. Modify the extract_qa() function in utils/dataset_helpers.py
2. Add a new condition for your custom format
3. Pass the appropriate dataset_format value when calling build_judge_dataset()

### Minimal Requirements Summary

Your dataset must:

Contain preference pairs (```prompt```, ```chosen```, ```rejected```)

Allow extraction of:

1. A single question
2. Two candidate answers

Once formatted properly, the rest of the pipeline (LLM-as-a-Judge → DPO → Evaluation) works unchanged.

## Environment Setup

From the **root of the repository**, install the `ref4-llm-alignment-ethics` dependency group using `uv`:

```bash
uv sync --group ref4-llm-alignment-ethics
source .venv/bin/activate
```

> **CUDA note:** `torch==2.6.0` from PyPI includes CUDA support on Linux. If you specifically need the CUDA 12.4 build, run:
>
> ```bash
> uv sync --group ref4-llm-alignment-ethics \
>   --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
> ```

### Installing `flash-attn` (optional, for faster attention)

`flash-attn` requires CUDA headers and `setuptools` at compile time and cannot be installed via `uv sync`. After activating the venv, install it manually:

```bash
pip install flash-attn==2.7.3 --no-build-isolation
```

> **Note:** This step requires a GPU node with CUDA available. Skip it if you are running on a CPU-only machine.

## Notes

- Run notebooks sequentially from **01 → 05**.
- Ensure GPU availability before running ```02_inference_runner.ipynb``` and ```04_dpo_training.ipynb```.
- The quality of alignment depends strongly on the judge model and prompt design.
- Our results might have less win rate since we used only 300 samples for training, for better results use larger amount of data.


# Discussion & Conceptual Checkpoints

These questions are intended to help participants reflect on the design choices behind Con-J and DPO.

### 1. Why does Con-J generate a rationale instead of predicting a scalar reward?

**Answer:**  
Scalar reward models compress evaluation into a single number, which makes their decisions difficult to interpret and audit. Con-J generates both a rationale and a binary decision, increasing transparency and making it easier to detect bias or flawed reasoning.

### 2. Why is judgment filtering necessary before DPO training?

**Answer:**  
LLM-generated judgments can be inconsistent or biased. Filtering ensures that only correct (positive) judgments are contrasted against incorrect (negative) ones. Without filtering, DPO training could reinforce incorrect reasoning patterns.

### 3. What advantage does DPO have over RLHF?

**Answer:**  
DPO directly optimizes preference differences without requiring reinforcement learning or PPO-style optimization. It avoids training a separate reward model and is simpler, more stable, and easier to reproduce.

### 4. How do repeated and hint sampling improve the judge model?

**Answer:**  
Repeated sampling increases diversity in reasoning patterns, while hint sampling encourages informative rationales. This produces stronger contrastive pairs for DPO training and improves robustness.

### Open Discussion

What risks might arise if the LLM-as-a-Judge itself becomes biased or overconfident in its reasoning?
