# Mechanistic Interpretability Overview

## Introduction

This folder is the **mechanistic interpretability** module for the Interpretability for LLMs and Agents Bootcamp.
Instead of treating models as black boxes, we use *internal activations* to build causal, testable stories about
how they compute.

This module covers two complementary settings:

- **LLMs**: the central mystery is **superposition** (many concepts packed into the same neuron / direction). We use
  **Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)** to turn dense activations into a sparse, interpretable feature dictionary.
- **VLMs**: the central mystery is **modality fusion** (where and when does visual information become language?).
  We use the **logit lens** and **activation patching** to localize the causal bottleneck for visual influence.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you should have:

- **Python**: 3.10+
- **Environment**: ability to run Jupyter notebooks (JupyterLab recommended)
- **Background**: basic familiarity with transformers and PyTorch
- **Hardware**: a CUDA-capable GPU is recommended (CPU may be slow)
- **Accounts/Access**: a HuggingFace token may be needed (the LLM notebook uses `huggingface_hub.login()` and the
  notebooks may download model weights on first run)

## Notebooks

The following Jupyter notebooks are provided in this folder:

1. **[LLM SAE Tutorial](Mechanistic_Interpretability_LLM_Tutorial.ipynb)** — *From black boxes to sparse features*
   - **What you’ll do**:
     - Load an LLM in **TransformerLens** and pick a hook point (e.g. `blocks.L.hook_mlp_out`).
     - Load a pretrained **SAE** (Gemma Scope / SAELens ecosystem) and run:
       `activations → SAE encoder → sparse features → SAE decoder → reconstruction`.
     - Find interpretable features via **top-activating examples** (what tokens/contexts trigger a feature).
     - Run a **feature steering** demo (amplify / clamp-to-zero a feature direction and observe behavior changes).
   - **Key outputs**:
     - A short list of candidate features with their strongest triggering contexts.
     - A steering demo showing causal behavioral changes from a single feature direction.
     - Simple “dark matter” proxies: **reconstruction error** + **behavior gap** (e.g., next-token logits / KL gap).

2. **[VLM Tutorial](Mechanistic_Interpretability_VLM_Tutorial.ipynb)** — *Where does vision become language?*
   - **What you’ll do**:
     - Inspect a VLM as **vision encoder → connector (projector) → language model**.
     - Apply a **logit lens** layer-by-layer to watch visual tokens “turn into words”.
     - Use **activation patching**: corrupt the image, restore one layer at a time, and measure how much clean
       behavior is recovered to find the causal fusion bottleneck.
     - Compare the VLM story to the LLM SAE story and discuss VLM “dark matter” (information not yet linguistic).
   - **Key outputs**:
     - Layer-wise logit-lens signals (e.g., entropy/decodability trends for visual tokens).
     - A restoration curve from patching that highlights where visual information becomes causally important.

## Package Dependencies

This implementation includes a small local package (installable) defined in
[`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) (project name: `mech-interp`).

Key dependencies include:

- **`transformer-lens`**: TransformerLens model + activation caching/hooks (LLM tutorial)
- **`sae-lens`**: loading/working with pretrained SAEs (LLM tutorial)
- **`transformers`, `accelerate`, `huggingface-hub`**: HuggingFace models + downloads (both tutorials)
- **`torch`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `tqdm`, `pillow`, `requests`**: core runtime + plotting/utilities

## Getting Started

Run these commands from the **repo root**:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies for this module
uv sync --group mechanistic-interp

# 2. Launch JupyterLab
uv run jupyter lab implementations/mechanistic_interpretability/
```

Then open one of the notebooks listed above and run the cells in order.

> **Note:** Do not install the `mechanistic-interp` and `xai-refresher` dependency groups
> together — they conflict. See the Troubleshooting section if you hit an `ImportError`
> about `datasets`.

## Troubleshooting

`ImportError: cannot import name '__version__' from 'datasets' (unknown location)`

This happens when the `xai-refresher` dependency group has been installed in the same
environment. That group includes `xl-vlm`, which ships its own top-level `datasets/`
module that shadows the HuggingFace `datasets` package.

Fix — from the repo root, reinstall `datasets` to restore the missing `__init__.py`:

```bash
uv pip install --force-reinstall "datasets>=4.0.0"
```

Then restart the kernel and re-run the notebook.

To prevent this permanently, never install the `xai-refresher` and `mechanistic-interp`
dependency groups together (they are declared as conflicting in the root `pyproject.toml`).
